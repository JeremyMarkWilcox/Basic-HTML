        <h4>Below are two examples of my favorite and I believe most practial Okinawan Weapons to learn to defend oneself.</h4>

        <h2>Sai</h2>

        <h4>A sai is an Okinawan weapon (Usually used in pairs) that appears to be for stabbing/thrust attacks but in actuality the instrument was used to blunt and disarm katanas wielded by the invading Japanese samurai. The Okinawan used what they could, modified farmer tools.</h4>
        <h2>Bow(Staff)</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Desktop\Website\Image\bow.jpg">
        <h4>A bow(staff) is a Okinawan weapon that is a very efficient weapon for fighting at a distance, as well as quick flailing attacks. This is a useful weapon to learn since many tools and items can be used in place of the traditional wooden form.</h4>
